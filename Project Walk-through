## Step-by-Step Deployment

---

## 1. Virtual Machine Creation

### Domain Controller (DC01)
- OS Type: Windows Server (64-bit)
- RAM: 4–6 GB
- Disk: 60+ GB (VDI, dynamically allocated)
- Network Adapter: Internal Network

### Client Machine (CLIENT01)
- OS Type: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- RAM: 4 GB
- Disk: 40–60 GB
- Network Adapter: Same Internal Network as DC01

---

## 2. Windows Server Installation

1. Install Windows Server with **Desktop Experience**
2. Set a strong local Administrator password
3. Rename the server to `DC01`
4. Reboot to apply changes

---

## 3. Static IP & DNS Configuration

1. Configure a **static IPv4 address** on DC01  
2. Set Preferred DNS Server to the DC’s own IP address  
3. Verify connectivity using `ipconfig` and `ping`

> Active Directory requires static DNS to properly resolve domain services.

---

## 4. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

1. Open **Server Manager**
2. Add the **Active Directory Domain Services** role
3. Promote the server to a Domain Controller:
   - Create a **new forest**
   - Domain name: `DC01`
   - Set DSRM password
4. Reboot after promotion

---

## 5. Active Directory Structure

### Organizational Units (OUs)
Created under the domain:
- `_Users`
- `_Groups`
- `_Computers`

### Users
- Created multiple test user accounts
- Applied consistent naming conventions

### Security Groups
- Global Security Groups created (e.g., `IT-Admins`, `HR-Users`)
- Users assigned to groups to support role-based access

---

## 6. DNS and DHCP (Optional Enhancement)

- Verified DNS forward lookup zone for `DC01`
- Confirmed presence of `_msdcs` records
- (Optional) DHCP role added to automate client IP assignment

---

## 7. Client Machine Domain Join

1. Installed Windows 10/11 on CLIENT01
2. Configured DNS to point to DC01
3. Joined CLIENT01 to the `DC01` domain
4. Rebooted and logged in using a domain user account

This validated domain authentication and connectivity.

---

## 8. File Shares & Access Control

1. Created shared folders on the Domain Controller
2. Configured NTFS permissions using **security groups**
3. Removed direct user permissions
4. Verified effective access from CLIENT01

This demonstrates **least privilege and RBAC principles**.

---

## 9. Group Policy Configuration

1. Opened **Group Policy Management**
2. Created custom Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
3. Configured:
   - Password complexity
   - Account lockout thresholds
4. Linked GPOs to appropriate OUs
5. Forced policy updates using `gpupdate /force`

---

## 10. Validation & Testing

- Logged in with domain users
- Confirmed GPO enforcement
- Verified access to shared resources
- Reviewed Security Event Logs:
  - Successful logons (Event ID 4624)
  - Failed logons (Event ID 4625)

## Skills Demonstrated

- Active Directory administration
- Identity lifecycle management
- Group-based access control
- Windows networking fundamentals
- Policy-based security enforcement
- Troubleshooting and validation
